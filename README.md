## Exploring the Role of AI in Software Development
### We are a group of Computer Science students — Alex, Mark, Diego, and Jackson — working together to explore the role of artificial intelligence in software development. Our team brings a mix of skills, creativity, and curiosity as we learn, experiment, and collaborate on building projects that highlight both the potential and challenges of AI in coding.
